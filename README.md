# [Project : Market Basket Analysis](https://github.com/NasirNisar/EDA/tree/main/Market-Basket-Analysis)
This is a project I did for my 4th capstone, where I build a market basket analysis for a market basket optimization.

* Data was taken from the kaggle dataset
* The model uses both; content-based filtering techniques and collaborative filtering techniques
* Algorithms Used : Apriori, Association Rule

## Summary
More and more organizations are discovering ways of using market basket analysis to gain useful insights into associations and hidden relationships. As industry leaders continue to explore the techniqueâ€™s value, a predictive version of market basket analysis is making in-roads across many sectors in an effort to identify sequential purchases.



# [Project 2: Online Shoppers Intension](https://github.com/NasirNisar/EDA/tree/main/Online-Shopper-Intentions)
This is a project I did for my 5th capstone, where I predicted the shoppers behaviour.


* Data was taken from the kaggle dataset
* Online shopping is a huge and growing form of purchasing and represents a huge portion of B2C (Business to Customer) revenue. 69% of Americans have shopped online at some point (1), with an average revenue of $1804 per online shopper(2). 36% of Americans shop online at least once per month! Learning how and when shoppers will research and purchase goods online is important to businesses as they can use customer behavior insights to target advertising, marketing, and deals to potential customers to further increase their sales and revenue.
* Algorithms Used : K-Mean Clustering, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classification, Permutation Importance, PDP Visualization

## CONCLUSION
When do people purchase?

Visit the page that had high average value(Page Value>=0.9805)
When they did not bounce from the site(Bounce Rate<0.0001)
Visit to thier account management pages was low.,or high was also paired with even higher average value(Page Values>=21.9806)
